# Child_Language_Acquisition_Analysis

Here is the analysis of the pattern of children language acquisition data recognized by a [rule-based syntactic structure identifier]([url](https://github.com/obiasaidi/Child_Speech_Structure_Identifier)) for children speech.  
  
The pattern follows the Stage of Acquisition (SoA) model  the 'Growing Tree' model (Friedmann, Belletti, & Rizzi, 2021). The idea is that English children's grammatical competence develops in (discrete) stages, different complex syntactic constructions at specific SoA. 

Libraries needed to analyze the data:  
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
